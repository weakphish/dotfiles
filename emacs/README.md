# Emacs Config
Sometimes I dabble in Emacs, specfically Doom Emacs. I just put in here my `config.el` which is what Doom uses for personal setup, as far as I know.

If my setup becomes such that I require more than just the `config.el`, I'll add it, but so far I'm okay with manually adding stuff to the `init.el` on each computer since at the moment it's just adding an LSP flag to the lanuages I use.
