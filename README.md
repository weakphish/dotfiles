My dots.
Run `bootstrap.sh` `link-mac.sh` to symlink the configuration to your system.

**Current editor**: Helix, with JetBrains for large refactors/debugging
 
**Shell:** Fish shell with omf to manage prompts, etc.

**Terminal:** iTerm2, see `itermcolors` for the colorschemes I like. Usually, with Iosevka 14 or JetBrains Mono 12.

Also included is...
- a bare `.vimrc` that enables lines and syntax, as well as a setup script for Mac systems
- A Neovim configuration based on kickstart.nvim
- A Doom Emacs config, because org-mode is cool
