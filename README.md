My dots.
Run `link-mac.sh` to symlink the configuration to your system.

**Current editor**: A mix of VS Code and JetBrains tools (GoLand and PyCharm, usually)
 
**Shell:** Zsh. See .zshrc - it's just stock oh-my-zsh with the prompt switched to Powerlevel10k.

**Terminal:** iTerm2, see `itermcolors` for the colorschemes I like.

Also included is a bare `.vimrc` that enables lines and syntax, as well as a setup script for Mac systems and a Doom Emacs config for when I randomly
try org-mode for the Nth time.
