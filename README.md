My dots.
Run `link-mac.sh` to symlink the configuration to your system.

**Current editor**: Formerly Neovim, currently Helix.

**Shell:** Zsh. See .zshrc - it's just stock oh-my-fish with the prompt switched to Bira.

**Terminal:** iTerm2, see `itermcolors` for the colorschemes I like.


Also included is a bare `.vimrc` that enables lines and syntax, as well as a setup script for Mac systems.
