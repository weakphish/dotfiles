My dots. I've provided a setup script for Debian-based systems that handles most of the setup. I've recently moved to macOS, so I probably should update it with brew commands, but alas, I'm lazy.

Also, I added in a .vimrc even with a neovim configuration present because with the usage of the new M1 Mac's speed, I've almost entirely moved to VS Code as my primary editor since speed isn't a reason to use NeoVim anymore. Therefore, I'll be using plain vim for quick edits since VS Code starts about as fast as NeoVim. However, I'm keeping the config here for posterity.
