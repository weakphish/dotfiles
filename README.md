My dots.
Run `bootstrap.sh` `link-mac.sh` to symlink the configuration to your system.

**Current editor**: Neovim, with JetBrains IDEs for heavy refactoring/debugging.
 
**Shell:** Fish shell with omf to manage prompts, etc.

**Terminal:** iTerm2, see `itermcolors` for the colorschemes I like. Usually, with Iosevka size 13.

Also included is...
- a bare `.vimrc` that enables lines and syntax, as well as a setup script for Mac systems
- a Doom Emacs config for when I randomly get interested in Lisp/Org-Mode
- a helix config
