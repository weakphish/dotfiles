# dotfiles
My dots.

**Current editor**: Neovim primarily, but dabbling in Doom Emacs. See: `nvim` and `emacs` directories, respectively.

**Shell:** Fish shell. See `fish` which just has my custom prompt. I typically use `fisher` to manage packages and use the `lambda` package, and my Mac setup script handles installing that.

**Terminal:** iTerm2, see `itermcolors` for the colorschemes I like.


Also included is a bare `.vimrc` that enables lines and syntax, as well as a setup script for Mac systems.
