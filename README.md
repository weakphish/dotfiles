My dots.
Run `bootstrap.sh` `link-mac.sh` to symlink the configuration to your system.

**Current editor**: VS Code, with JetBrains IDEs for large refactors/debugging. 
 
**Shell:** Fish shell with omf to manage prompts, etc. I also like to use [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) for workspace / pane / tab management in the terminal.

**Terminal:** iTerm2. See the `iterm` folder for a collection of colorschemes I've saved.

**Git Porcelain:** LazyGit

**Other Software:**
Other software that I use as a developer on a regular basis:
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), a Spotlight/Alfred replacement
- Good ol' pen and paper for note-taking and to-do lists.

Also included is...
- a bare `.vimrc` that enables lines and syntax, as well as a setup script for Mac systems
- A Neovim configuration based on kickstart.nvim
- A Doom Emacs config, because org-mode is cool
- a Helix config, because I think Helix is awesome (and patched once ;) )
